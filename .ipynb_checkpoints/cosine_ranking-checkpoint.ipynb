The terms cervical, cancer and HPV appear to play a very important role in the ranking of results for query one. Japan did as well, but the first occurence of this word in the ranking is much lower. The second tweet was very short, and each word seems to have played an important role in ranking. Tumor,leg, mccain and straight are all extremely common in the results. Also noteworthy is the fact that we have many short tweets in the results, showing that shorter documents receive higher ranks.The final query was relatively longer and we can see a greater diversity of important terms in the results.
